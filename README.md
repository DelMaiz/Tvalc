# tvalacarta

## What's this?

tvalacarta is a program created for you to watch on demand videos from Spanish TV sites using your media center.

## Devices

There are different versions of tvalacarta depending on the device it has been designed for. It works on XBMC / Kodi, Plex or Boxee. 

Future planned devices include Android, iOS, Enigma2, Roku and an improved support for Smart TV devices.

## Why i do this?

I do it because I like it. 

I don't know if a lot of users will use it, but even if I am the only user i still do the work.

And I publish it because this never would be possible without XBMC / Kodi, an incredible project totally open and free. 

This way i return a fraction of what I have received.
